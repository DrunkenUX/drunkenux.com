So we’re talking Rokus, we’re talking Amazon Fire Stick, we’re talking Android TV. Being able to click the button on my Fire Stick remote and say, “I wanna watch a movie with Brent Spiner in it” and get Independence Day. Awesome. Let’s go.

AARON
He’s in Independence Day?

MICHAEL
Yeah. He’s the crazy mad scientist with long grey hair.

AARON
No way. Today I learned.

MICHAEL
Fun fact. I have a sign photograph of Brent Spiner in that role.
