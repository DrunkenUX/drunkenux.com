Our apologies for being a day late this week. I hate missing a schedule, but I'm pretty happy that since launching <em>Real-Time Overview</em>, we haven't missed a single week. So that's pretty awesome. The roundup this week hits several different notes (as it should), starting with a look at how to get into coding later in your career, if you're looking to change up your job into web development. We follow up with some UI pieces looking at scrolling and prototyping before getting into CDN performance and wrapping up with another show's episode on technical debt. All the links are down below!

Keep your podcast apps warm for Monday. We have something special coming up!
