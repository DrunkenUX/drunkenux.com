This week Aaron and Michael are joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/alainawiens">Alaina Wiens</a> from the <a href="https://strategycar.com/show/">StrategyCar Podcast</a> to talk about the wild world of web strategy.

Before diving into that topic, we review Michael's recent experience interacting with a chatbot designed by the Kansas Division of Vehicles to process car registration renewals.

The technology might be new and flashy, but does it really provide a better experience to the end user? Is it about a better experience, or just cutting costs without regard for the impact? I guess you need to listen to know. Here's some stuff to help though (it's worth noting, there's a lot of <em>really</em> positive material out there on this topic, but it's largely generated by people selling and/or promoting the technology):

Our main topic this week focuses on a high level look at web strategy, how it's changed, and what you can do to trying a plan for success better through it. The topic of "web strategy" itself has followed an interesting trend as the field has matured and diversified through people specializing in different areas.
