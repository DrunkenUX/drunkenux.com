<p>This week we bring back <a href="https://drunkenux.com/podcast/build-process-2-sean-marcia/">previous </a><em><a href="https://drunkenux.com/podcast/build-process-2-sean-marcia/">Build Process</a></em><a href="https://drunkenux.com/podcast/build-process-2-sean-marcia/"> guest Sean Marcia</a> to join Aaron in a chat with Michael about the Ruby for Good project and their project DiaperBase. Together, we take a dive into what it takes to coordinate and set up an open source project, along with some of the factors that may influence certain technical decision-making you'll have to be a part of as your project evolves.</p>
