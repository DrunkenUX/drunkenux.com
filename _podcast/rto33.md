<p>A Thursday edition of <em>RTO</em> this week bring a quartet of articles for you to enjoy. We get started looking into how design principles can improve your ability to pitch projects, then move on to some considerations for autocomplete textboxes over select boxes. From there, some advice to deal with clients that don't get back to you quickly, the risks and rewards of sticky headers, and finally, an awesome look at dark patterns in mobile.</p>
