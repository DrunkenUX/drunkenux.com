It might be the 4th of July, but we aren't letting that stop us from making sure you get your weekly dose of <em>Real-Time Overview</em>. Michael's returned from Boston and back at the helm for this week, kicking things off with the news that 500PX just ditched Creative Commons because... well, they say it wasn't being used, but that seems like a weird reason to us. Go go go Flickr! We've got some design articles for you covering footers and flexible text, a little accessibility nugget, some UI inspiration at UIDB, and finally, we wrap up with a look at how to recharge your creative juices.
