This week's RTO update is a little shorter, but has some great material in it nonetheless. Absolutely do not miss Invision's Design Genome Project. The work going in to that is producing a lot of incredible insights into how successful companies approach design, and it can be a great resource for ideas to adapt to your team. My favorite code editor, Atom, has released their latest update that you should check out. And among some other topics, we look at some tips for being successful while working from home. If that's a topic that interests you, be sure to check out Jason Fried and David Hansson's book <em>Remote</em>, which is linked below.
