Today's episode features Michael and Aaron taking a deeper dive into the subject of higher ed websites which was <a href="https://drunkenux.com/podcast/episode-5-can-you-take-me-higher-ed/">started in Episode 5</a>. The best part is, episodes 5 and 6 were recorded together, so this episode features twice the drunken hosts for our user's experience. We look into both the challenges facing homepages for universities, as well as how university news is used and handled (or not).

Part 2 of our ruminations on higher ed websites starts with an update to the story surrounding Snapchat's recent app updates. If you want to know more about that, check out some of this news before going on to the rest of the episode links:
