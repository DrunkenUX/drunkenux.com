<p>In several past past episodes, Aaron and Michael have made references to <a href="https://amzn.to/2MmxSF7">Steve's Krug's seminal book on usability </a><em><a href="https://amzn.to/2MmxSF7">Don't Make Me Think</a></em>. This week's episode takes a look at that book, and reviews several of the concepts and principles that it introduces. From how people use sites, to how you can test them on a budget, we look at a number of ways you can work usability into your design and development.</p>
