Today we're interviewingÂ <a href="https://github.com/seanmarcia">Sean Marcia</a>, a developer at <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/">USCIS</a> and the founder of <a href="https://rubyforgood.org">Ruby for Good</a>, an annual conference for Ruby on Rails developers to volunteer their skills for non-profits. We were able to catch him on the eve of Ruby for Good's fifth year.

Sean discusses things that have changed for him in his journey as a developer, and shares some advice for newer developers. We also discuss the Ruby for Good conference, what he enjoys about mentorship and how that plays into the mission of the conference.
