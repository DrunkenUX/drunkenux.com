This week includes a run by Jen Simmons' YouTube channel Layout Land, a review of content security policy problems in a research paper at Google AI, a look at a tool that lets you create pages that store their data in the URL, a new class on atomic design and Pattern Lab at Gymnasium, and we wrap up looking at what you might want to consider when it comes to looking at a headless CMS for your next project.
