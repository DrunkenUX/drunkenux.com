I hope everyone had a great 4th of July and took some time to relax. We also hope you caught <a href="https://drunkenux.com/podcast/14-i-got-my-design-philosophy-and-i-trust-it-like-the-ground/">episode 14 of <em>DUX</em></a> where we talked with Greg Podunovich about design philosophy. This week's article round-up starts off taking a few punches at hamburger menu icons. You hate them, we hate them, and your users hate them. So here are some better ideas. We follow that up with an article stressing inclusive design by trying to use the web with a keyboard for a day (try it yourself and let us know how it goes), then some SEO tips, a look at Vue.js, and some ideas about how to prototype in the browser.
