Big week coming at you today. Everyone's talking Gutenberg lately - and I have some of my own questions still. This should help ease your mind about the update a little though. Then we look into a program trying to expand the field of AI, following up with some tools to check out this month. After that, we get into some really great reads on design and hiring you definitely shouldn't miss out on. All the story links from the show, as always, are below.
