<p>Man, today's articles will give you some great material, and some even better debate opportunities. We get started thinking about what defines success, and how we talk to others about it. Then, NNG has put out another piece on the problems with carousels - this time as it applies to mobile. Then the fight starts. Is WordPress at a crossroads? What does the future look like there? After that comes my favorite article in a while, that looks at "slow design," or the idea that maybe MVP isn't the best goal. We wrap up with some technical points on HTTPS, specifically as it applies to static sites.</p>
