So if you listened to the end of <a href="https://drunkenux.com/podcast/episode-2-living-in-an-ecomm-paradise/">Episode 2</a>, this is clearly not the episode on higher education websites. Fear not! It's still coming, we've just made some changes to the production plans for that episode and wanted to push it out a few weeks to better address some of the goals we had for it. Stay tuned for when that will be dropping. Instead, this week we return to the topic of video, this time looking at the subjects of content findability and general platform <abbr title="User Experience Design">UxD</abbr>.
