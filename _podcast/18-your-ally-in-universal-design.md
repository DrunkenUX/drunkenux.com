<p>Many of you are off for Labor Day, so we wanted to be sure you had something to do today for fun. What better than a new episode of <em>The Drunken UX Podcast</em>? This week we are joined by art director <a href="http://www.tatianamac.com/">Tatiana Mac</a> in a chat about accessibility and universal design and its importance in your design process.</p>

<p>The concept of accessibility extends well beyond the checkboxes many designers and developers are used to trying to complete for <acronym title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</acronym> compliance. Truly thinking about accessibility means considering intent of the rules, and circumstances and conditions of the users who come to your site. It's no easy task, but today's episode might help you plant the seeds to start thinking about your processes as the starting point for more holistic products that work well for everyone.</p>
