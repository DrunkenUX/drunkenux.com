Wednesday is here, and so too is our weekly roundup. Links are below, as you might expect, and our tour takes us from color tools, to an image reveal example and beyond. We've included a couple articles this week on Design Thinking, which is a design methodology that's been around since the 60's, and on the folks who have helped shape our industry. Both should be a nice history lesson that bear nice fruit that's still useful today.

There's also a script to help you generate bulk SEO meta descriptions to speed up content work, and a guide to UI and UX work.

If you'll be at An Event Apart in Boston next week, let us know! Michael will be running around there, and he'd love to say hi and chat for a bit. We'll be looking to do some rapid fire Q&amp;A stuff with a few people while we're there as well.
