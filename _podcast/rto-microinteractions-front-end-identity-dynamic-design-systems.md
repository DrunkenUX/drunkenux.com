<p>Happy Halloween everyone! Our last <em>RTO</em> for October is ready for you with more thoughts on the value of designers learning how to write some front end code, a great piece on how microinteractions affect UX, considerations for what exactly makes a front-end developer a front-end developer, an update to an old article considering how Gutenberg will affect WordPress's future, and finally some advice to make your design system flexible and dynamic.</p>
