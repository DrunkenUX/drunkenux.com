<p>It's time for your favorite web development article roundup in podcast episode form of the week! Because we know there are so many of those, naturally. Anyway, start things off with a look at things you shouldn't be doing on your sites in 2019 (or now, or last year, really). Jared Spool has a piece looking at Agile and <abbr title="user experience design">UxD</abbr> after that. Our third spotlight is on an incredible piece looking at why websites look more the same than ever - don't miss it. Finally, we wrap up looking at fictional sites and some advice on creating usable forms.</p>
