<p>It's here! The day is upon us! G-Day! That great day of Gutenbergedness has finally come, and, well, at least it's here. Right? Right? Regardless of where you stand on Gutenberg, the band-aid has at least been ripped off, and now it's time to get to work on our sites, our themes, our plugins, and see what the future holds. Instead of our normal roundup this week, we look at a few articles to help you understand what's coming, and some resources for planning your future development.</p>
