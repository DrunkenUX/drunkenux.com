<p>Fresh back from HighEdWeb 2018 in Sacramento, and while it might be late this week, we know you need your <em>RTO</em> in your life. So, we've put together some good ones for you. We kick off with a bit of web design history and trip through the various trends through the years we've seen. From there, we take a hard right turn into WordPress news. There's a lot going on there right now, both related to Gutenberg and not, and there's likely to be something there you'll be interested to know.</p>
