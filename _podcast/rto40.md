This week's RTO kicks off with some advice for approaching your work to ensure you do the best you can. From there, a look at Amazon from an outside user and the usability problems that plague their system. Next we share a resource for quick CSS snippets with explanations. Our next to last trip is to CSS-Tricks to see if front-end development is being treated like a problem and then finally we wrap up on our look at microstrategy with microcopy.
