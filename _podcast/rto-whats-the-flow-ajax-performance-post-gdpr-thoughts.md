We're running behind this week, and we apologize profusely, but we had a good reason. We're fresh back from the <a href="http://webaccessibilitysummit.org/">Web Accessibility Summit</a> in Columbia, MO, and man was it a good day of discussions with a ton of folks. But, we haven't missed a week yet, and we don't plan to start now. The links below go over a ton of material, and I promise it's all pretty darn good. Alex Handley's piece kicks things off with some great information on user flows (it's also funny, which is fun). Adam Silver writes about AJAX performance and how you shouldn't use AJAX as a crutch to making things feel fast.

Before we're done, we can't end the show without talking about GDPR for a second, and then we hit some resources with new tools and an Adobe XD guide. There's a little something for everyone. Oh, and then there's the plug of the new thing we're working on which will launch later this month. Be excited. Because we are.
