Wow. So that happened. SmugMug acquiring Flickr was one thing. Microsoft buying GitHub? I mean, we all knew there was more than a passing interest in the idea, but I never would have called the $7.5 billion number for it. This acquisition has a lot of implications, and rather than trying to find one perfect article to sum it all up, we've linked a bunch down below to cover most of the pros and cons. Check them out, listen to the episode, and let us know what you think about it.

We spend a good amount of time chatting about that, but we still covered our normal roundup too, looking at Dieter Rams' design principles, tools for GDPR compliance, WordPress debugging, and a couple article about professional development. In hindsight, we ended up with several articles that were lists of things, but so shall it be, once in a while.
