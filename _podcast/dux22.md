<p>This October marks the 5-year anniversary of the launch of HealthCare.gov - the insurance marketplace search platform that was conceived as part of the needs to support requirements of the Affordable Care Act. That launch, somewhat infamously, stalled in spectacular fashion at the starting line. The project was plagued with problems and high costs, and serves as a source for many useful lessons in web project management. Aaron and Michael review some of these lessons and what you should take away from it for your next project.</p>
