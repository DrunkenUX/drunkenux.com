<p>This week's news roundup kicks off with a look at building fluid interface components, and the design theory behind them. Next is a piece on how JavaScript is negatively impacting page load times. Following that is a look at the increasingly cranky feedback being generated now that WordPress is actively inviting users to come test Gutenberg. We wrap up with two last pieces, one looking at dark UX at Amazon, and the other looking at how design and development teams can better collaborate.</p>
