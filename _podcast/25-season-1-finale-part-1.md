<p>We're here! We made it! Today marks part 1 in our special, two-part season finale to round out the first full year of producing <em>The Drunken UX Podcast</em>, and man does it feel good to be here. In this part, Aaron and Michael spend some time looking back on the year, how we got here, some of the challenges we faced, and what our goals were.</p>
