Ah yes, Wednesday, that faithful day when we bring you news updates in web development from around the web. Today's cornucopia is abundant indeed, with acronyms everywhere. We get started with an update to information we provided in Episode 4 of the Drunken UX Podcast before digging in to information on Google AMP performance, OOP JavaScript development, a great look at the importance of GDPR compliance, and some softer topics like analytics, UX, and design. We hope you enjoy the selections this week! Have some resources that you think build on any of these areas? Be sure to share them in the comments below.
