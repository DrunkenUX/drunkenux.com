<p>Big news on the block over the last week, as Gutenberg accessibility issues and politics are taking the front stage in the weeks leading up to the WordPress 5.0 RC and eventual launch in November. Between a new accessibility-focus dev joining Automattic, to losing the team lead and many new discussions putting Gutenberg under a microscope, the near term is looking to be pretty rocky.</p>

Rather than our normal round-up format today, I wanted to spend some time sharing my thoughts on the issues, and our need to become more accessibility minded as developers in a much more general sense, notwithstanding anything to do with WordPress, Gutenberg, or React specifically.
