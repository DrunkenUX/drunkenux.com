<p>This week Aaron and Michael jump into three popular weather websites and poke them with a sharp stick while making observations about how frustrating they can be (see also: ads, too many ads), and what can be done to improve them. Aaron might have also started a new business venture in the process, we aren't totally sure.</p>
