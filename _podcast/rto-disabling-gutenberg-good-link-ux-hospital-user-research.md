Selected just for you this week, a hearty crop of the best from around the web development news circles. Two stories on WordPress - one with advice on how to avoid the upcoming Gutenberg editor, and the other looking more broadly at how WordPress has affected theÂ  web development industry. We also look at research into user needs for health care providers, some tips in how to create good, usable links, and finally we go off the beaten path to think about ergonomics and standing desks.
