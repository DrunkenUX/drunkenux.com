<p>A beautiful new Smashing Book is released, an argument for why Gutenberg will be good for WordPress and page builder plugins, GitHub drops jQuery, making a case to come to terms with the hamburger icon, and a look at the rise and fall of RSS make up this week's <em>Real-Time Overview</em>. We'll think you'll enjoy this selection, and there's maybe even a good argument or two to be had.</p>
