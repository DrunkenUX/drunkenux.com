Given that we're the Drunken UX Podcast, it seems only fitting to start this week with an article looking at drunk user testing parties for applications. It's a contentious idea in the community, to say the least. Bottom line, us drinking and talking about web development for your entertainment: Good. Companies throwing parties to have people drink to expose them to their application and collect feedback: Maybe not so good.

Lots more stuff follows on the heels of that, with a tool for looking up application keyboard shortcuts, lessons from a Google designer, how to sharpen your design eye, a review of good rules for UX designers, and finishing up with some ideas for how Amazon can improve their product recommendations and search.

Let us know if anything this week jumps out at you as being especially useful! We love hearing about what you're finding helpful or interesting.
