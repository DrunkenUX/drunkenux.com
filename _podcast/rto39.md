<p>Thanksgiving is on the way, so be sure to queue us up for your travels! This week, RTO is ready for you with a quick selection of helpful choices just in time for the holidays. We start off with two articles that follow up on past recommendations with more information on design homogeneity and micro-experiences. Next, a piece tackling the SEO challenges presented by site redesigns, a tutorial on using <code>:empty</code> and <code>:blank</code> psuedo-selectors, and then finally we wrap up with a pieces arguing for textareas to replace individual address fields.</p>
