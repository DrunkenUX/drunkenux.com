With the release of version 2.6 of the Gutenberg preview plugin, WordPress is edging closer to a new editing experience that will dramatically impact the way people use the platform. Special guest <a href="https://wptavern.com/">Jeff Chandler of WPTavern</a> and host of the WordPress Weekly podcast joins us this week to talk about what the eventual release of the Gutenberg editor will mean for developers and users once WordPress 5.0 drops.

This episode is packed with resources to help you learn about Gutenberg, keep up with its development, and prepare your own development to support it. Those are all linked down below. If you have a favorite tool, resource, or article that we didn't touch on, be sure to leave it in the comments for others to check out! Have you tried the Gutenberg preview yet? Are you excited about the opportunities that will come with the new blocks system? Let us know!
