<p>This week starts with a couple different JavaScript related posts. Our first one looks at how JS dependence is bad for the canned theme market. The second offers an ES5 tutorial on using the <code>.filter()</code> method make array data easy to pick through. From there, spend some time learning about aspect ratios at Canva, get some advice on what to not put in your portfolio, and finish up with a look at the curious case of scroll bouncing.</p>
