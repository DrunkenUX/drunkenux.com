<p>Three, three, three topics in one! This week we tackle a trio of topics to change up the pace. First we share some thoughts about Google's announcement that it's closing Inbox, and then we talk about what it could mean now that the EU Copyright Directive is moving on to the next phase. After the break, we spend the second half of the show looking at Google AMP and whether or not it has a place in your future toolbox.</p>

<p>Let us know how you like this changed-up format. If you like it, perhaps we'll revisit it more in the future!</p>
