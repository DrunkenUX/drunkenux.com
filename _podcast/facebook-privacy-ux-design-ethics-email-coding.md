Pretty much everyone had their eyes on Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress on Tuesday. In the spirit of that, we start with a story on Facebook, but on how they can improve privacy UX, not on the events from the day. That's a nice start, and we move from that into looking at Chrome updates to support CSS Typed Object Model, which might get a little technical, but is a great thing to see coming to JavaScript. Last week we discussed dark patterns, and we keep that going with a story on design ethics that was inspired by the video we shared. Things round out this week with accessibility, email, and some bad UX examples. A great crop of resources by great people for great listeners.
