<p>Hey folks, this is our next to last RTO of the year! Sorry it's a little late this week, but as always, we think it'll be worth the wait. This week, we start off with a piece on security headers on sites, which is the first in a 4 part series on website security. There's a piece on business advice for designers, another on different techniques for naming colors, and a look at what Microsoft moving to Chromium means for the future of browsers. Finally, we wrap up with a piece on accessible form styling.</p>
