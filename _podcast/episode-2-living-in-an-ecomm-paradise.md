In today's episode, we tackle the large and weighty topic of ecommerce. Well, specifically, we're going to look into two facets of shopping online: product sorting and checkout processes. We'll review how and why sorting can be confusing for users, what makes it ineffective, and how overly complicated checkout procedures are costing online retailers millions of dollars. Do you want to make millions of dollars? I bet you do. Listen to today's episode to figure out how.*
