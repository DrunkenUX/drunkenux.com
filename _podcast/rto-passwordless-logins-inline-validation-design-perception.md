This week we take a trip to the RSA conference in San Francisco to see what Google and Microsoft are proposing as part of the Fast Identification Online Alliance. Will it be the next OpenID? From there, a brief overview of how to style bulleted lists before getting in to how to build your SASS to support reusable spacing tools. Next, looking at why inline form validation can cause users more headaches and the role perception plays in design. This week ends with a look at Walmart's website redesign and the bold decisions they are making to reshape their ecommerce experience.
