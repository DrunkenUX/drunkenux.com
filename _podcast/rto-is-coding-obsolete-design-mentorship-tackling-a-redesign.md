Here's a special Thursday edition of <em>RTO</em> this week. Sorry for the delay, but we've put together a good list of articles for you to check out. Two of our choices are two-parters - one on the impacts of the no-code revolution and building programs with visual designers, the other on improving your landing page conversion rates. Besides those, we've got recommendations for doing good data visualization, why design mentorship is a good practice, and some suggestions for how to tackle a website redesign project.
