We've weeded through all the April Fools nonsense to find the best meaty bits of web news for you all. For instance, what do you know about immersive design, AR, and VR? We've got some info on it for you. Interested in learning about web development, but find the process daunting? Don't worry, we've been here a while and so do we. That's okay. We also hit up a couple coding articles and a course you can check out, as well as a look at dark patterns and how we address things at work. All in all, a good, nicely rounded collection of stories. Enjoy!
