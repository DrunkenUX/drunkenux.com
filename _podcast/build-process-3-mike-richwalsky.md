<p>Mike is a long time veteran of the higher education marketing and web development fields and is currently living in Drew Carey's neck of the woods, Cleveland, Ohio. From starting out working on sites in the mid 90's, he's gone on to build and market sites, created applications aimed at connecting people, and created infrastructure for website hosting. We couldn't be more happy to have him on to share some of the lessons and stories he's collected on the way.</p>
