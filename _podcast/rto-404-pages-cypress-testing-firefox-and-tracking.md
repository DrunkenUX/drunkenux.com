<p>It's that time of the week! We've got a pair of stories that focus on work Mozilla is doing covering research and user tracking. Both are worth a read in your spare time. If it's design inspiration you need, we review a roundup of 404 layouts and some advice on modeling yourself after big brands. We also have a killer piece from CSS-Tricks on using Cypress for end-to-ending testing that shouldn't be missed by anyone doing dev work.</p>
